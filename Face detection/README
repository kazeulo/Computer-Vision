Face Detection

1. Read Howse Chapter 5
2. Create a program that implements human face detection in a real-time video.
Upon recognizing a face or set of faces, your program would do something creative.

Some suggestions:
* swapping multiple faces
* replacing face with something scary or funny
* catching a falling object (apple)  with your (Newton's) head
* decorating the detected face with make-up, masks, or anything fancy
* using the movement of your face as a controller to a game
